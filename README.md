## About

Want to play your favourite game but don't have anyone to play with? We have been there but didn't want to stay there, so we made Buddy Up! Let us help you find your next buddy.

At Buddy Up, we want you to have the space to meet others who are your kinda people.

With this release of Buddy Up, our focus is on gamers. Want to play minecraft but don't fancy it alone today? No problem, request a buddy and anyone who is looking for a buddy will join your party. Otherwise, have a look at what other people are looking for and maybe it is soemthing you want to give a go?

Not a gamer? No Problems! We are looking at developing buddy up for people wanting to meet in person for board games, jam sessions, knitting circles, book clubs and the like. All of us at Buddy Up want to make a space for the nerd amongst us!

## Usage

Please follow the link below to see the deployed app:

FIXME: Add deployed link.

## Wire Frame

FIXME: add wire frame imgs

## Future Developments

You have come to Buddy Up as we have started - welcome to the party! We have lots of ideas for the furture but here are a few key things we want to do:

1. We love playing games - but not just video games. We love board games, card games, sports games, any and every game under the sun. So we want to broaden the options available. We want this to be your space!
2. We want to add the ability to locate who you are Buddying Up with. That way, you can meet and play
3. We want you to be able to add your own game/activity, so that you can do what you want to do!
